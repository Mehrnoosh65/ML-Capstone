Capstone Project Notebooks and Files

This repository contains the following notebooks, and Python file as part of the Capstone project:

Capstone EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis (Capstone-EDA-Visualizations-Copy.ipynb): This notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and insights into the "UCSF-PDGM" dataset of MRI brain images. It includes data exploration, statistical analysis, and data visualization techniques to better understand the dataset.

Capstone - Wrangling & Visualizations (Capstone-Visualizations-Segmentation.ipynb): In this notebook, the data preprocessing steps, including image wrangling and segmentation, are performed. The notebook also incorporates visualizations of tumor regions within the MRI images, using the collapsing technique along the X, Y, and Z dimensions.

Capstone - Convolutional Neural Network with Transfer Learning (Capstone-CNN-System.ipynb): This notebook focuses on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary classification of brain MRI images into tumor and no-tumor categories. Transfer learning is applied to improve the model's accuracy and performance.

Copying_Selected_Files_2Destination_Folder.py: This Python script handles copying selected files from the dataset to the destination folder, facilitating easy access and manipulation of relevant data during the project.
